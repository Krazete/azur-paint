# Azur Lane Painting Reconstruction

Builds sprites from the jumbled Texture2Ds and Meshes available in `Android/data/com.YoStarEN.AzurLane/files/AssetBundles/painting` folder. Can also extract facial expressions from `paintingface` and can sometimes paste them properly on those sprites.

Inspired by [Scighost/AzurLane-Painting-Tool](https://github.com/Scighost/AzurLane-Painting-Tool/blob/6d6301257a558d9dbde4a65e4cf25650fca797c8/AzurLane-Painting-Tool/PaintingInfo.cs#L260) which made it look easy enough.

Not gonna continue this because better tools like [nobbyfix/AzurLaneTools](https://github.com/nobbyfix/AzurLaneTools/blob/bac50d1ed83c9b3614d8bea884a3743c9cf0264c/Assets/lib/imgrecon.py#L10) already exist and because I don't want to put the effort into figuring out the more complex sprites (like Arbiter: The Tower XIV, whose background and main sprites are differently scaled) or edge cases or proper face placement.
